By Didrik Sten Ingebrigtsen 

The project is about ordinary and regularised linear regression, and implements functions for performing it, as well as resampling and tuning. Provided is also two examples, one with synthetic terrain data (generated by the Franke function), and one with real terrain data. 

To reproduce all results, run these commands: 
>>> python tune_and_evaluate.py franke 
>>> python tune_and_evaluate.py real 
>>> python plotting.py 

Unit-tests implemented with pytest.
