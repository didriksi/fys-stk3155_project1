# FYS-STK3155 project 1 
By Didrik Sten Ingebrigtsen 

The project is about ordinary and regularised linear regression, and implements functions for performing it, as well as resampling and tuning. Provided is also two examples, one with synthetic terrain data (generated by the Franke function), and one with real terrain data. 

The project report pdf is here in the root folder, the plots generated by the code in the /plots folder, the .TeX file to make the pdf report is in the /latex folder. The data stored by the codes are stored in /dataframe. All the code is in the /python folder. Quick breakdown of the modules:
- linear_models has the classes for fitting and predicting with linear regression
- resampling has bootstrap and k-fold
- franke and real_terrain creates the data sets
- data_handling splits the data
- franke_verify does some simple tests on the franke set, and demonstrates some key aspects of linear regression
- metrics just has the functions for MSE, R^2 etc
- tune_and_evaluate houses the function for making polynomial design matrices and the big Tune class, that finds optimal parameters
- validation_test makes and splits a dataset from the validation data generated by Tune.validate()
- plotting has a flexible function for making several plots in a grid, a function for making heat maps and animations of validation error, and a scatter plot for validation and test error

To reproduce the main results, run these commands: 
- python tune_and_evaluate.py franke 
- python tune_and_evaluate.py real 
- python plotting.py 

To get some plots of the input data, run:
- python franke.py
- python real_terrain.py

To get the verification plots testing out overfitting etc. on Franke data, run:
- python franke_verify.py

Unit-tests implemented with pytest.
